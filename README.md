# HN

HN is an alternative frontend to YCombinator's [Hacker News](news.ycombinator.com/). It's lightweight, mobile friendly, has a dark theme and doesn't send JavaScript to the client.

The main instance can be found [here](https://hn.gigantino.dev).

## Roadmap (1.0)

- [v] Algolia Search implementation (Thanks to @vclemenzi)
- [ ] Saved posts
- [ ] Comments improvements **(HIGH PRIORITY)**
      Being able to view comments is one of HackerNews' primary features. While they are already implemented as of right now, threads don't have a set limit which highly affects performance. Also I personally don't find them too readable, which means the style should be changed too.
- [ ] Light theme
